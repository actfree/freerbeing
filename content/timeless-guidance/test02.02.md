Although no research has been published on the bioeffects or health effects from exposure to 5G radiation, the IEEE Committee on Man and Radiation (COMAR) has published an “expert statement” in the journal Health Physics that claims “(w)ithin current exposure limits, there appears to be little or no risk of adverse health effects related to radiofrequency (RF) exposure from 5G system.”

According to the IEEE press release (below): 
“… COMAR is an organization composed of physicians, biologists, epidemiologists, engineers and physical scientists who are experts on health and safety issues related to electromagnetic fields who work voluntarily and collaboratively on a consensus basis.”
