As a child, brought up as a Christian in the 60s and 70s, I was full of natural, spontaneous joy, light and love; singing, laughing and praying often\
As I grew-up the worries of the world increasingly clouded my innate inner Truth\
Despite discovering spiritual practice, in the form of yoga, in 1986 I continued to make many 'wrong turns', spending much time lost and floundering in the dark\
I fully committed to daily self-practice and study in 2004 and started leading groups in 2006

Spiritual practice, and the Truth it reveals, did as it will do, was, and is, my stability and my saviour\
I still make 'wrong turns' at times, but less often, and I find my way back onto my path, into my Truth, again more quickly

I live again filled with joy, light and love\
It was always there, though I could not always see or be it\
I am graced\
I am grateful

All my work is offered freely, with love, in the spirit of service\
May it be of benefit to those that find it
