As a child Kai was full of joy, light and love,\
singing, laughing and praying often\
Discovering yoga in 1986 he continued to make many 'wrong' turns,\
spending much time lost in the dark\
Spiritual practice, and the Truth it reveals, was, and is, his saviour\
He committed to daily self-practice and study in 2004\
and started leading groups in 2006

Kai has found his light again\
He feels graced and is grateful

All work is offered with love, in the spirit of service
