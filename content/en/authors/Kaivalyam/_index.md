As a Christian child in the 60s and 70s this invisible yogi was full of natural, spontaneous joy, light and love; singing, laughing and praying often\
As I grew-up the worries of the world increasingly clouded my innate Inner Truth\
Embarking on the practical spiritual path of yoga in 1986, I continued to make many 'wrong turns', spending much time floundering in the dark\
I committed to daily self-practice and study in 2004 and started leading groups in 2006

Spiritual practice did as it will always do for those who dedicate themselves to it, was, and is, my stability, my release and my liberation\
I still make 'wrong turns' at times, but less often, and I find my way back onto my path more quickly\
I am again filled with joy, light and love\
I am graced\
I am grateful

My studies and application of ancient wisdom come largely from the Yoga/Samkhya model\
I also find value in drawing from other traditions, such as Gnostic Christianity, Buddhism, Quantum Physics, and in the many, and often unexpected, places where I recognise Truth, or at least the attempt to express such\
I find the parallels, and the contrasts, between perspectives to be useful and interesting

All my work is offered freely, with love, in the spirit of service\
If you like it, please consider sharing it\
May it be of benefit to those that find it
