- Sit with an upright spine and comfortable base, on the floor with a cushion if you can be comfortable, or in an upright chair
- Set a timer at a length that is appropriate for you
- Close your eyes
- Focus your attention on the breath as it moves in and out of your nose
- When you notice that the mind has wandered, as it certainly will, gently bring your focus back to the breath
- Repeat 2x daily, morning and evening

### Notes:
Repetition is key to successs

Do not change or alter the natural rhythm of your breath, let it be as it will

Do not be harsh on yourself when you notice that the mind has wandered again, this is the nature of the mind

The goal is to focus attention, not to stop thoughts altogether
