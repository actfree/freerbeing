As with anything in life success on the spiritual path depends largely, if not exclusively, on how much we put in towards achieving our aims\
On how much we want it\
In fact, this is even more so the case, because the obstacles to spiritual progress are internal

Practice constitutes the removal of our own blockages and impurities\
That removal process *is*  the practice\
Obstacles and problems are very much an inevitable part of this\
To overcome these we must retain enthusiasm and a strong determination

In reality, the only things that stands between a seeker and their Light are the universal human afflictions; ignorance, ego, desire, hatred, fear etc ...\
 ... their own personal obstacles, things like: sickness, pain, doubt, carelessness, laziness, etc\
Thus, our own earnestness and commitment is of central importance\
For those who are urgent and ardent the goal is near

In effective and authentic spiritual practice, as we move towards the clarity and joy of a settled mind, we are working with the laws of nature\
If we employ appropriate procedures, what must happen, according to those laws, will happen

Success is guranteed, and close, for those who are dedicated and commit
