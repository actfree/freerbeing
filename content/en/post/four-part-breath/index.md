Learning to breathe consciously is of enormous value to us\
In appropriate asana and pranayama practice we can  learn how to do this\
Working with the breath strengthens our entire system, breath being so fundamental to life, and leads to vitality, health and a radiant energy

Conscious breathing focuses and clears the mind, allowing the space for deeper experience

**The breath has four distinct phases**:
- Inhale
- Pause
- Exhale
- Pause

Each phase has its' own qualities

**Inhale**:
- Energising
- Refreshing
- Warming

**Exhale**:
- Calming
- Cleansing
- Cooling

The pauses, largely speaking, reinforce and enhance the qualities of the previous phase\
So the pause after the inhale deepens the energising effects of the inhale\
The pause after exhale deepens the clarifying effects of the exhale
