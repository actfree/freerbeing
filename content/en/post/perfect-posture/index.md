**The sanskrit word for posture is 'āsana'**

This comes from the root 'ās' .. to sit, reflecting the
ancients' focus on seated practice\
Modern yoga practice emphasises, for better or worse,
movement and breathing

Whether in seated meditation/breathing, or during active
bodywork/āsana practice, two elements of posture are
involved; the work we do to achieve stability, first,
supports, second, the blossoming into a spaciousness

**Sthira**:
Stability, firmness, balance, steadiness, constancy, stillness\
An active, doing-type quality,  the application of effort

**Sukha**:
Comfort, spaciousness, relaxation, ease, acceptance,
surrender, openness\
A passive, being-type quality,  a letting-go on our behalf

In seated meditation our posture is upright, but not rigid,
relaxed, but not slack\
In our āsana practice the two are engaged in a constant,
more dynamic, play

To survive and thrive a tree must have firm roots
and a strong trunk\
But it must also flex and move with the wind

>Yoga sutras II:46\
>"sthira-sukham-āsanam"
