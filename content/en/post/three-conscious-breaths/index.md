We can consciously change negative and unpleasant thoughts and feelings by deliberately breaking their flow

When feeling anger/stress/panic/bad-will/etc:

- Close your eyes
- Bring your attention to your own breath
- Breathe through your nose, if possible
- Hold your attention there for the duration of three breaths
- Observe the entire length of each inhalation and exhalation

You may or may not notice an immediate effect, but, chances are, your bad feelings will subside, or even disappear altogether, as a result of this quick and simple practice\
Integration of regular meditation into your daily life will support and deepen further positive changes
