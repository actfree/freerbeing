## There is suffering
As individual souls, each streaming from the common Source,
we are responsible for our own actions and their results\
This is karma

## There is a cause of suffering
Our unconscious, habitual actions create karmic seeds/habits
 in our energetic field, which cause us to act in ways that lead
 to pain in the future\
Our situation now is a result of our past actions\
Future pain orginates in our actions and intentions now

## There is an end to suffering
When we re-connect with Source our actions become
naturally more harmonious and our future suffering, and
 thus that of those around us and in the wider world,
is reduced\
By improving our clarity and becoming more aware, we
 can avoid previous mistakes

## There is a path to the end of suffering
We can re-connect with Source through the consistent and
appropriate practice of quietening the mind, without
attachment to any outcomes
