For something so fundamental to life, the process of breathing is often only dimly understood\
It just happens, right?

A clearer understanding of the actual mechanics involved can greatly help in achieving a strong and healthy breath\
Which in turn leads to a strong and healthy life

We breathe primarily with the chest and the diaphragm\
The abdomen can be of secondary use but is not a prime mover in the process\
Confusion around this can lead to inefficient breathing and a wasting of energy

The process is as follows;

**As we inhale:**
- The ribcage expands by the action of the intercostal muscles
- The diaphragm contracts (though this may seem counter-intuitive) and pushes downwards

  The downwards action of the diaphragm causes the abdomen to push out and it may appear to expand\
  But there is no cavity for the air to enter which would cause the abdomen to expand\
  It can only change shape, and is not actively required for the inhalation

**As we exhale:**
- The chest relaxes and contracts
- The diaphragm relaxes and lifts

   We can, optionally and optimally, engage the muscles of the abdomen in order to support the exhale but actually it is gravity which closes the chest cavity

In yoga asana and pranayama we learn to employ the abdomen to strengthen and support the exhalation\
This aspect of practice is also physically strengthening, including to our core musculature

Techniques involving forceful exhalation, such as bhastrika and kapalabhati, can be of great value, properly practised, but forceful use of the abdomen is not required for normal daily breathing

The technique of "belly-breathing", (ie "inhaling into the abdomen") whilst perhaps having some value for some people by visualisation of the deepening of breathing, is potentially confusing and can mis-direct the attention from where it is most effectively placed
