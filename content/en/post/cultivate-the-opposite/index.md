Often our thoughts, words and actions are caused by unconscious, habitual, "lower" feelings, such as fear, hate, mistrust and possessiveness, and cause harm to ourselves\
and to others

We can recognise that we have headed off the path and make an effort to head back in the right direction by interrupting our misguided thoughts, words and resultant harmful actions, and by considering the results of these

Consideration and care towards others, and towards ourselves, combined with appropriate, committed spiritual practice supports us as we unwind these negatives\
Cultivating positive attitudes is more effective than struggling with negative ones
