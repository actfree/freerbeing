Christ is not Jesus' surname\
The word "Christ" refers to the reaching of a higher state of being/consciousness

The name of the person we call "Buddha" was Shakyamuni Siddharta Gotama\
Again, "Buddha" refers to a state of illuminated being

These words are an acknowledgment, an accolade, an honorific given to one achieving a full realisation of our common human Inner Truth

In the image above we can see use of symbolism common to the two traditions, Buddhism and Christianity;\
The halos and the blessings made with the hands

The core purpose of all spiritual practice traditions is to become aware of ourselves as this Inner Reality, to ourselves recognise our own Christ/Buddha nature\
It is our disconnection from this Reality which causes all our sorrows and troubles, and reconnection is thus their solution

The teachings of both Jesus and Gotama were the same;\
Look inside, love and serve others, and there you will find peace, freedom and truth

>*"I love to talk of Jesus because he was a man of perfect Self-realisation\
>However, he was not the only son of God, nor did he claim to be"*\
>**Paramahansa Yogananda**
