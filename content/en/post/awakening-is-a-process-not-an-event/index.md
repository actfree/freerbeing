We are not 'asleep' one moment, learn or experience something, and then in the next moment are 'awake'\
It does not happen like that\
The path is long, we move forwards and upwards step by step

The process of awakening is the steady removal/unwinding of our own self-created limitations and blocks\
This takes time\
We do our daily work, without seeking particular outcomes, and move steadily and surely forwards\
Sometimes perhaps even falling backwards

For the dedicated and committed practitioner there may well be, at times, big jumps, quantum leaps even, of personal evolution\
We may pass recognised "landmarks" on the spiritual path, such as a kundalini opening or an experience of samadhi\
Yet even such a "big" experience, shift or realisation, lasting perhaps moments (measured in "normal time"), may take years to fully integrate, and does not signify the end of the road

For the committed conscientious practitioner success is guaranteed

Thus, orient yourself towards the goal, and step forwards
