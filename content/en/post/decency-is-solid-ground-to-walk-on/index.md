An established decency and integrity in how we
 interact with those around us provides a firm foundation
for us to walk our individual paths on\
Indeed, it is essential to successful progress

Patañjali offered us the *yamas*\
They are universal principles, foundational to a
healthy society

We are, from birth, inter-dependent on others, morality guides us to build healthy and fruitful relationships\
How we behave towards others reveals our state of mind and our personality

### Patanjali's Yamas:
- Non-harm, non-violence, consideration and kindness
- Truthfulness, right communication
- Non-stealing, not taking that which is not ours
- Moderation, right direction of our energy/attention
- Not coveting, grabbing or accumulating

The Buddha added:
- Non-intoxication
