​### Why Life?
#### Why our individual lives?

According to the Vedic science Samkhya, reality consists of two fundamental, and always distinct, aspects;
Spirit/Seer/Purusha & Nature/Seen/Prakriti
It is the interplay of these that drives creation, and hence our individual lives
Spirit illuminates and animates nature
The resulting movements in nature create experience for Spirit in order that It can come to comprehend Itself

Our confusion of the two aspects leads to disharmony and suffering, but, correctly understood, they lead to bliss and freedom
Worldly experience is for the liberation of Soul by understanding
Yoga spiritual practice is applied Samkhya, consciously engaging with this purpose, and supports us as we move towards understanding

########

We have talked about how we confuse our temporary, limited, ego-identity with our Deeper Eternal Self, and how that causes us to suffer
Why does this confusion occur?
