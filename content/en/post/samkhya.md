*Samkhya* and Yoga go hand-in-hand.
The *Samkhya* model explains the universe and our place in it.
Yoga supports us to experience the realities *Samkhya* postulates.

The name '*Samkhya*' is derived from the following words: number, enumeration, reckoning, summing-up, calculation, deliberation, reflection, reason, intellect.
It can be seen as meaning something along the lines of 'a collection of numbered lists'.
This reflects the fact that the *Samkhya* breaks down the principles of cosmic evolution into categories using reasoned, scientific logic.

**Brief overview here**

One of the six orthodox Vedic philosophies, or *darshana*, of ancient India, *Samkhya* teaches discriminative knowledge which allows us to understand what we are, by deducing what we are not.
It is important to the study of Yoga because Yoga is the practical application of *Samkhya*.
The two *darshana* are often referred to together as the *Samkhya*-Yoga school.
Where  *Samkhya* views the universe as a whole, a macrocosm, Yoga uses the same principles to relate to the individual, a microcosm.
*Samkhya* demonstrates that suffering, *dukha*, is caused by ignorance of our true nature, *avidya*.
Yoga offers a practical means to the realisation of that true nature.
*Samkhya* explains the universe through reason.
Yoga is the practical means (primarily meditative) which leads to the ability to discriminate between that which we are and that which we are not.
The goals of both *Samkhya* and Yoga are the elimination of suffering and the liberation of the soul.

The Bahagavad Gita acknowledges the two:

> "In this world there are two roads of perfection ... Jnana Yoga, the path of wisdom of the *Samkhya*, and Karma Yoga, the path of action of the Yogis"
> BG3:3
> Translation by Juan Mascaro.

***Purusha* and *Prakriti***

*Samkhya* states that there are two fundamental realities: '*Purusha*' and '*prakriti*'.
We might use words like: 'Cosmic Consciousness' or 'Soul,' and 'cosmic substance' or 'quantum energy field'.
These account for everything that was, is and ever will be.
Their interaction is the source of all things.
All evolution and manifestation, every thing, is a result of the relationship between these two principles.
All experience and existence is derived from the eternal interplay of this duality.

*Purusha* (Sanskrit derivation: 'man' or 'person') is the first of the principles/tatvas in the *Samkhya* system.
It is Consciousness, Being, Knowing, Awareness.
It is the Soul of the universe.
It is the animating principle in all beings, the Soul or Spirit.
It is infinite, unbounded, immanent, omnipresent, indestructible.
It is the intrinsic subject in all things and in which all things are inseparably submerged.
*Purusha* is pure, content-less, shapeless, passive and unchanging.
It is Source, our true identity.
*Purusha* is that which we truly are.

*Prakriti* (Sanskrit derivation 'making before/first') is everything other than *Purusha*.
It is matter, energy, the quantum field.
It is the primary substance from which all things derive.
Inanimate, unintelligent and unconscious, *prakriti* is the root source of all manifestation, the passive power of creation.
It is the principle from which all attributes and all action come.
It is infinite, eternal, limitless, shapeless, everywhere without boundary.
It existed before anything was produced.
It was not caused but causes.

*Prakriti* consists of three powers/forces, the *gunas*, the interplay between which accounts for all diverse manifestation.
[Understanding the *guna* model]({{< ref "gunas-understanding.md" >}}) is also very useful in our Yoga practice.

**Relationship**

The relationship of *Purusha* and *prakriti* manifests all.
How does that relationship work?

*Prakriti* is the blind man carrying the lame man, *Purusha*.
The blind man can act but cannot perceive, the lame man can sense but not act.
The joining of the two is to their mutual benefit.
*Purusha* is given action/movement.
*Prakriti* is given perception/vision.

> Our Soul is *Purusha*, everything else is *prakriti*.
> "*Purusha* is absent in a corpse, all that is left is *prakriti*".
> TKV Desikachar.

**Evolution**

The *samkhya* evolution then breaks down the constituent parts of the universe so that through clear logic we can understand what we truly are.
It concerns itself with the cosmic evolution of the universe, stating that all things have order and that nothing is random.
It divides evolution into categories which we can know and understand.

These categories are classified under four main groups;

1. That which was not caused and does not cause: *Purusha*
2. That which was not caused but causes: *prakriti*
3. Those which are caused and cause
4. Those which are caused and do not cause

The third grouping lists principles known as 'evolvents' (caused and cause).
These are:
Cosmic intelligence/*mahat*,
Individuation/ego/*ahamkara*, and
Five subtle elements/*tanmatras*: Sound, touch, form , flavour, odour.

The fourth grouping consists of principles known as 'evolutes' (caused and do not cause).
These are:
Cosmic mind/*manas*,
Five abstract knowing senses/*jnanendriyas*: hearing, feeling, sight, taste, smell.
Five abstract working senses/*karmendriyas*: expression, procreation, excretion, grasping, and movement.

**Conclusion**

*Samkhya* takes a little getting your head around.
But, if you wish to take your understanding of Yoga (and of life!) to a deeper level, it is worth it.
A comprehension of the principles gives us a solid, philosophical foundation to build our Yoga practice on, and help us to live full, happy and healthy lives.
Yoga practice can then give us tools and techniques to support and guide us to experience the reality *samkhya* posits.

The Yoga Sutras state that the only reason that the seen world, *prakriti*, exists is that the true self, *purusha*, can come to know itself.

### YS 2:21

> "It is only for the sake of the Self that the world exists"
> Alistair Shearer

Whilst an understanding of *Samkhya* is very useful, essential perhaps, and intellectual discussion of its details and nuances inspiring and interesting, Yoga practice gives us direct experience of the truths beyond words.
You can't best that.
