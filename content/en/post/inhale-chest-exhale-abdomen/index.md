People often find themselves confused about the mechanics of breathing

We breath primarily with the chest
An engaged abdomen can play a supporting role in the exhale

As we inhale the diaphragm contracts and drops as the intercostal rib muscles open the ribcage
This causes the air pressure inside the lungs to drop, and thus the air to rush in

On exhalation the diaphragm and the chest muscles relax, thus contracting the lungs, raising the pressure in the lungs causing the breath to rush outside

The abdomen, whilst appearing to expand as we inhale, cannot actually do so
There is no cavity or space for it to do so, it can only change shape
Engaging the abdomen can play a very beneficial role in supporting the exhale

It is interesting to consider that we have no direct control over the air
Air is massive
We can only create the conditions that facilitate the movement of air into and out of our bodies

A note about "belly-breathing"
While "belly-breathing" may be a useful visualisation in some cases, it can also be misleading as we do not, as shown above, breath with our bellies
There are some breathing techniques involving rapid and forceful use of the abdomen to "punch" the air out during exhale

In our practice it is generally more useful to focus as follows - inhale:chest, exhale:abdomen
