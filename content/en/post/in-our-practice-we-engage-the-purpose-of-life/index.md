## Why Life?
## Why our individual lives?

According to the Vedic science *Samkhya*, reality consists of two fundamental, and always distinct, aspects;\
**Spirit/Seer/*Purusha* & Nature/Seen/*Prakriti***

It is the interplay of these that drives creation, and hence our individual lives\
Spirit illuminates and animates Nature\
The resulting movements in Nature create experience for Spirit in order that It can come to comprehend Itself

Our confusion of the two aspects leads to disharmony and suffering, but, when correctly understood, they lead to bliss and freedom\
Worldly experience is for the liberation of Soul by understanding

Yoga spiritual practice is applied *Samkhya*, consciously engaging with this purpose, and supports us as we move towards the wisdom, and freedom,  that comes with understanding
