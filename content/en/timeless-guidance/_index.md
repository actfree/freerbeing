## The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali

**The Original self-help manual**

The Yoga Sutras are widely considered to be the core text of modern Yoga.  
This central approach to Yoga is known as Classical, or Raja/Royal Yoga.  
Although it may not always be apparent, a great deal of present-day Yoga practice, particularly in the West, has its roots in the Yoga Sutras/Raja Yoga.  

Scholars differ on many details of the origin of the sutras but we can be reasonably sure about some aspects, if specifics can be sometimes fuzzy.  
Written, in Sanskrit, by a seer/rishi called Patañjali (or possibly a group of seers) around 2-2,500 years ago.  
This was the first time the knowledge of Yoga was written down, having always been taught orally, via chanting, prior to this.  
A student would have had to learn the entire scripture, by heart, before he (no Yoga for women back then) was accepted to be taught techniques.  

The text defines Yoga, what it is, what it is intended to achieve, how to approach practice, what will happen when practised.  
Consisting of 196 short, poetic verses/phrases (sutra means 'thread') dense with wisdom, the text weaves together immense ancient wisdom to give us a map to guide us on our journey through life and in our spiritual practice.  

The text is divided into four chapters.  
Each chapter delineates a specific area of Yoga practice.  

**Chapter 1 - Samadhi - The Clear Mind**  
Discusses the nature of Yoga and the state of clarity/mastery of mind to which Yoga practice aspires.  
**Chapter 2 - Sadhana - Practice**  
Discusses the various aspects of actual practice and principles to support it.  
**Chapter 3 - Vibhuti - Yogic Powers**  
Discusses the results of Yoga practice and the strengths/powers/gifts therein.  
**Chapter 4 - Kaivalya - Freedom**  
Discusses the state of absolute Freedom that  a yogi can achieve.  

The original is, of course, in sanskrit.  
Non-sanskrit speakers are therefore dependent on commentaries and translations.  
There are many to choose from, and exploring as many as possible will give a better understanding.  

Chanting of the sutras is still a very beneficial practice.  
It focuses the mind (a primary Raja Yoga goal) and supports us in enhancing our knowledge and our practice.  

Patañjali does not tell us how to practice specific techniques.  
He does not address the details of posture practice or of pranayama, for example, rather, the text gives us broad principles to work with.  
The Yoga Sutras contain very powerful knowledge and give us solid, proven foundational axioms to work with in our own choice/use of the many ways of employing techniques.  
In this way, Yoga can be understood in a much broader context than is usually the case.  
By absorbing the sutras, the practice of Yoga can be understood not as any specific group of techniques and not as mere physical exercise.  
The Yoga Sutras show us, above all, that yoga is a way of life based in spirituality.
