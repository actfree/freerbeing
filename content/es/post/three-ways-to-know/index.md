The purpose of spiritual practice is to come to know\
With knowing we achieve wisdom\
Wisdom bestows such gifts as freedom, joy and harmony

There are three ways in which we can come to a knowing;

- **Inference/deduction**\
Someone enters the house dripping wet, we can infer that it is raining
- The **valid testimony** of a trusted other\
A person we trust tells us "It is raining"
- **Direct personal experience**\
We go outside and experience the rain

Of these three, direct experience is the superior knowing\
We can gain direct experience of Inner Truth by consistent committed and appropriate practice
