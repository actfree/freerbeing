Facts about Covid-19

Dr. Erickson COVID-19 Briefing [Essential Cut]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zed_U257j4o
Two frontline US doctors, immunologists, discuss the science of the covid reaction, and what they are seeing on the ground and hearing from colleagues.
Social isolation does not make sense.
Very clear and well presented.

Restricting blood flow with a tourniquet can keep catastrophic bleeding from killing the patient. But unless circulation is soon restored, tissue dies and limbs begin to rot.

~~

> Social isolation breaks the natural herd-immunity cycle.
With say flu, most people contract it, some have no symptoms, some get ill and recover, a few die.
Everyone ends up immune, the virus mutates, and it all happens again the following year.
Been like that since the dawn of humanity.
With isolation people don't get the infection, so they don't get immune.
If the death rate were actually as high as initially claimed then you could, perhaps, argue a case for isolation.
But as it stands, from a medical point of view it makes no sense, and at best will delay the infection's progress.
And from an economic point of view it is destructive madness.

Our immune systems are strong if we support them with good food and lifestyle etc.
I don't hear much mention of the natural approach in the mainstream narrative (except perhaps where it is attacked and undermined).
Could it be that there is no profit in it for The Big Boys?
