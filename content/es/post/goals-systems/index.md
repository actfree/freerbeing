It is a valuable thing to have clear, positive aims in life, destinations on our journey\
A goal to work towards gives us the structure and direction essential to arrival at success

This is true whether or not we actually attain to the goal\
Regular systems that develop positive habits that will lead us in the direction of those goals can actually be of greater value

Regularity and repetition in our behaviour causes actual physical changes in our brains\
The areas of the brain and the neurons that we employ grow and strengthen with this use, like muscles responding to exercise\
This is known as Hebb's Law: *"Neurons that fire together wire together"*

Positive habits are the vehicle by which progress is achieved\
They give us the means to move forward towards where we want to be\
They are the bicycle, not the road

In developing these we will likely find that our more "negative" habits will weaken and disappear without direct attention to them\
We cultivate the positives, the negatives fade of their own accord

The most important habit to master is that of turning-up\
The more we do this the easier and more established it becomes\
And, inevitably, step-by-step, we progress

We can aim for the perfection of the Buddha, Enlightenment, Perfect Freedom, etc, but need not be disappointed should we not achieve them\
The effort to attain them has improved us
